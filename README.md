This is one of my personal projects that I have started just to entertain myself and to learn about 3D graphics
1. The project goal was:
- To make some sort of working visualizer that can display 3D shapes.
- To learn how 3D rendering and files work.

2. About the project:
- This project is not polished at all and its only purpose is to display simple 3D shapes in a retro style.

!!!Important!!!  
To view some of the models included with the application select it from the dropdown menu on the top right.
You can open up your own .obj files in the app after putting them into the 3D-visualizer/Models folder.
