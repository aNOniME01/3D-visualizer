This is one of my personal project that i started just to entertain myself
1. The project goal
- To make some sort of working visualizer that can display 3D shapes.
- To learn how 3D and 3D files work and use this knowledge to import files into the visualizer.

2. About the project
- This project is not polished at all and it purpose is to display simple 3D shapes in a retro style.

!!!Important!!!  
You can open up .obj files in the app after putting them into 3D-visualizer/bin/Debug/net6.0-windows folder.
  
Feel free to steal my code.
